- Currently, the **retrieval folders** contains just the code that maybe would later used for Hybrid Search. **BUT currently maybe it is not used yet**. 

- We set all the **LLMs with temperature 0.1** currently. If you want the **fixed response** so maybe we should fix this.

- The **Planning Agent**: 
  - Should check if it nicely or correctly splitting the user question into multi subquestions later 
  - 

- The **Normalized Query Agent**
  - Currently the tools are manually defined in the PROMPTS, which is not good for extended used. should fix.
  - TOOLS / FUNCTIONS are currently registered to the Multi Agent Runner 
  - Normalized Agent workflow: normalize the query --> get tools and execute the tools
    ```json
    Query: "What are the latest trends in AI patents?"
    Output: {
        "query_type": "general",
        "identifiers": {
            "companies": [],
            "patents": []
        },
        "recommended_tools": ["patent_rag_retrieval", "hybrid_rag_retrieval"],
        "reasoning": "General industry trend query requiring broad patent analysis"
    }
    ```
    => Currently this in the Normalized query agent is not good for handling yet. What i would like is that, maybe the ```patent_rag_retrieval``` would give some patents. But to get the full information of each patent, we should also need to execute the ```exact_patent_lookup```
    => Also in the examples given in the PROMPTS for the normalized agent, we have missed the case of existing both the patents and the firms in the query. 

- The **Generalized Agent**
  - Code of ```_format_contexts``` not understand yet --> do not know if it is correct or not 
  - More specifically, not know why we need to check ```# Handle structured results if 'chunks' in result: ... ```

- 2 agents **Market Opportunity** and **Market Risks** is somewhat nearly the same. Just difference at the PROMPTs

- The **Market Manager Agent** contains lots of information in its prompts.
  - Maybe should define and confim which is needed which is not 
  - Currently we did not ask it to suggest about the technology or products based on the current market analysis yet 

- The **Fact Checking Agent** 
  - currently need to perform 2nd check on many things including sources. But it currently does not read the sources or any thing yet. It just read something like "Source: Company A, Patent B" but does not actually have accessed or reading the data source to check if exactly the sources there ? 
  - does not see ```is_response_reliable```, ```get_validation_summary``` and ```get_validation_summary``` use anywhere but already defined 

- Later need to change all the **printing stmts** now into the ```logger.info()```

- The hybrid retrieval is now in used but yeh still need to check 
- Fix LLM temp to 0 to have fixed response 
- Now the tools are dynamically added to the prompt, not manually anymore 
- Need to check the Normalize, Planning and Fact Checking Agent again.

- `utils/data_mapping.py`: logic works quite nice and might be needed for letting user try this "enchance searching" when on the streamlit application. 
- `tools/company_tools.py`: this file defines 2 tools which is `exact_company_lookup_tool` and `company_rag_retrieval_tool_wrapper` for retrieving exact company information or company context from RAG.
- `tools/patent_tools.py`: has the same logic as `company_tools.py`
- `tools/hybrid_rag_tools.py`: this file defines one tools that is `hybrid_rag_retrieval_tool_wrapper` function. The tool is used to retrieve the RAG context from both the firms and the patents.
- `tools/enhanced_hybrid_rag_tools.py`: this is expected to called the Hybrid Retriever (which is of sparse and dense retrieval) BUT not works as expected. 
  - Currently, this is somewhere like the `hybrid_rag_tools.py` but with more detailed information when we perform retrieving information. This is just returned many results than the previous versions. 
  - This file provides **tools** called `enhanced_hybrid_rag_retrieval_tool` for hybrid rag retrieval with enhanced info + `company_data_with_mapping_tool` for getting company data with enhanced mapping tool func + `mapping_key_search_tool` for seraching by mapping keys tool func.
- Checking `args.legacy`:
  - Currently remove it 
  - Now we only use the `run_enhanced_workflow` in `MultiAgentRunner`
- About the current performance of the system:
  - Current problem is that because we are working only on a sample of data. So maybe the number of company data is not aligned with the company of the patents. There would be case that for example the Intel company with hojinid of 701309 is not exist in the firm data but in the patent data. 
  ==> This suggests that we should immediately add and process more company data 
  - If you want to **check for information of a specific patents** and would love to see the market potential for it, this is currently ok for using now. 
  - Currently we handle the data for all the companies, both companies with patents and those not have 
  - The feature of **Enhanced Hybrid Search Results** (open streamlit app and on Enhanced Features tab) is working well for Motohashi requirements right now. 
  - Current problem for our systems: when asking a general questions like "tell me about the patents of company ABC" --> our system cannot understand this nice. Currently, it would perform RAG retrieval on company data. BUT the expected things to be done is that, it should get the ID or the name of the company, then perform that on the RAG retrieval for patents or performing retrieving exact patents information of the company.
  - And more, for example when asking a general question like "Tell me 3 patents that related to "Chemical Waste Industry". Then make a short comparisons", we can retrieve the patents and shortly compare them nicely. 

- Currently, the tools registry is not work as i expected. Currently, when we have a function, we still need to somehow defined its locally not automatically into the prompts. So maybe we should make use of the Langchain tools or some other ways to make this auto and reduce the complex logic and coding of the current things. Maybe should check all the files or location thaat we 'touch' tools registry: `utils/tool_registry.py`, `tools/*`, normalize agent...

- We should have a new logic like this: the planning or the normalize agent, they should define whether the question or subquestion need to continue process by the analysis team or not. If yes then we continue, If not we just skip there. I mean, if the question is just simply to answer something or find something, so we did not need to make use of the analysis team right? So yeah please make this logic for me professionally. 

- And more, currently, the words "hybrid search" here what i mean is that, we should perform the Dense + Sparse search. We want hybrid search (sparse + dense retrieval) when we need both high recall and high semantic relevance, especially in scenarios where:
  - Exact keyword matches are critical (sparse retrieval)
  - Semantic similarity is equally important to capture (dense retrieval)
  - The dataset contains both in-domain terms and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or paraphrased queries

- The input to the market opportunity and risk agents contains information about accummulated context but the generalize agent does not take care of it `accumulated_context` in the `_extract_context` of the `MarketOpportunityAgent`
- Need to recheck this `_extract_sources_from_contexts` in MultiAgent cause it depends on the Normalized Agent so the Normalized Agent should output nicely.
- It is likely that the Base Agent defined in the Agents Folders is not being used as the base class for other agents anymore isn't it. Recheck to see if we still need it or not. If yes so maybe we need to modified.
- This part of the Streamlit app is not well UI

  ðŸ”„ Initializing InnovARAG system...
  Running initialize_innovarag()

- In the Enhanced Features tab of the InnovARAG, we should have 
  - the features for looking for the information of the companies based on its hojinid or its name
  - the features for looking for the patents based on the patent unique id (`appln_id`). 
  - there should be a feature for searching for companies based on the context query (like we need to have feature for testing the retrieval of the RAG Firm)
  - there should be a feature like above but for RAG Patents

- `tools/hybrid_rag_tools.py`: this file defines one tools that is `hybrid_rag_retrieval_tool_wrapper` function. The tool is used to retrieve the RAG context from both the firms and the patents. ==> Now this has been removed. 
- Now, only the normalize agent has the Tools registry 
- Force reindex for all the patents + Company summary all with GPT Summary

- currently, the normalized agent is not good enough, the context does not contain the previous answer yet right, just part of it for example 1024 tokens only, which would ignore those older contexts

- fix the market manager to not only suggest like currently, but also contain the opportunity and risk summary from the 2 oppor and risk agents.
