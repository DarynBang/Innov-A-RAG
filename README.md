## ðŸ¤– Innov-A-RAG: Innovation Discovery Multi-Agent RAG Pipeline.

Run code to save firm summary and patents first -> Process query, either with patent or not.

### Things still need to add.consider:
- QueryNormalizingAgent/PlanningAgent: -> direct workflow
- Hybrid Retrieval (Denseâ€¯+â€¯Sparse): Augment vector search with a traditional sparse index (e.g. BM25) over raw text or keywords. Blend scores to maintain recall in case embeddings miss niche terms.
- ConsistencyAgent/FactCheckingAgent: add between Opportunity/Risk and Manager to flag glaring contradictions or hallucinations. (Considering)
- Perhaps combine both the MarketOpportunityAgent and MarketRiskAgent into a single agent? (Considering)
